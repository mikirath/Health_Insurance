## General Information
- The aim of the project is to estimate the approximate cost of a person's health insurance based on the given variables.
- As part of a bootcamp organised by Global AI Hub this project is being worked on.
- We are using the dataset available in Kaggle to complete this project.

## Conclusions
- The rate of a health insurance is highly dependent on the smoking behaviour of a person.
- The final model used is Random Forest as it provides a higher R2 score of 88 percentage which is decent.
